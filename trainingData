Deep learning is a subset of Machine Learning that deals with teaching machines to learn from data by themselves rather than being explicitly programmed. This technique is based on the concept of artificial neural networks, which are computational models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. Deep learning algorithms are able to process large amounts of complex data, extract meaningful patterns and make accurate predictions. This is achieved through a process known as 'training', where the algorithm is fed with a vast amount of data and the parameters of the network are adjusted based on the error between the predicted and actual outputs. This iterative process continues until the algorithm is able to make accurate predictions on unseen data. The success of deep learning can be attributed to its ability to handle unstructured and high-dimensional data such as images, audio, and text, which was previously a challenge for traditional machine learning methods. Cars have undoubtedly become an integral part of our daily lives.

As we continue to rely on cars in our daily lives, it is essential to also recognize the importance of responsible and sustainable use to ensure a better future for both ourselves and the planet. Hoppy is cute! Erosion is a natural process that has been shaping the Earth's surface for millions of years. It is the gradual wearing away of land and rock materials through the actions of wind, water, and ice. The forces of erosion are incredibly powerful, and they have the ability to completely transform the landscape over time. There are different types of erosion, including the gradual process of weathering where rocks and soil are broken down into smaller pieces, and the faster process of transportation where these pieces are moved to new locations. Water is one of the main agents of erosion, as it can carry large amounts of sediment and erode both soft and hard rock. As water flows over land, it can carve out valleys, canyons, and gorges. Water erosion can also lead to the formation of features such as cliffs, waterfalls, and beaches. In addition, powerful storms and floods can cause catastrophic erosion, carving deep channels and altering the course of rivers. The stars twinkled in the night sky.

Once upon a time, in a quaint village nestled between rolling hills and lush forests, there lived a young girl named Aria. Aria had a heart as pure as the crystal-clear stream that meandered through the village, and a spirit as free as the birds that danced in the sky above. Every day, Aria would wander into the woods, her curiosity leading her deeper into the secrets of nature. She delighted in the songs of the birds, the whisper of the wind through the leaves, and the gentle rustle of small creatures hidden in the underbrush. One sunny morning, as Aria roamed through the forest, she stumbled upon a hidden glade bathed in golden sunlight. At the center of the glade stood a magnificent tree, its branches reaching towards the heavens like outstretched arms. Enchanted by its beauty, Aria approached the tree with reverence. As she drew nearer, she noticed something peculiar nestled among the roots of the treea small, intricately carved box adorned with shimmering gemstones. With trembling hands, Aria lifted the lid of the box and gasped in wonder at the treasures within. Inside the box lay a collection of tiny glass figurines, each one more exquisite than the last. There were delicate butterflies with wings as fragile as gossamer, graceful swans with necks arched in elegance, and majestic dragons with scales that gleamed like precious jewels. Captivated by the beauty of the figurines, Aria reached out to touch them, but as her fingers brushed against the glass, a strange thing happened. The figurines began to shimmer and glow, and before her astonished eyes, they sprang to life, filling the glade with their magic. The butterflies danced on the breeze, painting the air with splashes of vibrant color. The swans glided gracefully across the surface of a nearby pond, their reflections shimmering like liquid silver. And the dragons soared through the sky with wings outstretched, their fiery breath lighting up the twilight sky. For hours, Aria watched in awe as the magical creatures brought the glade to life with their beauty and grace. And as the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the forest, she knew that she had stumbled upon a treasure more precious than golda treasure that would stay with her forever in her heart. With a contented smile, Aria bid farewell to the magical glade and made her way back to the village, her spirit soaring like the dragons in the sky above. And as she drifted off to sleep that night, she knew that she would always cherish the memory of the day she discovered the secret of the enchanted forest. And so, in that quiet village nestled between rolling hills and lush forests, the legend of the magical glade lived on, a testament to the wonder and beauty that lies hidden in the world around us, waiting to be discovered by those with hearts pure and spirits free.

Well excuuuuuuuuse me, princess! Ancient civilizations refer to the many advanced societies that existed thousands of years ago. These civilizations were characterized by their highly developed cultures, complex social structures, and advanced technologies. Some of the most well-known ancient civilizations include the Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Mayans, Aztecs, and Incas. The Egyptians, who flourished along the Nile River in northeastern Africa, were known for their impressive architectural feats such as the Great Pyramids and the Sphinx. They also had a highly complex belief system and were one of the earliest civilizations to develop a form of writing. The Greeks, who lived in the Mediterranean region, are often considered the birthplace of Western civilization. They made significant contributions to philosophy, mathematics, and art, and their city-states were known for their democratic forms of government. The Romans, who emerged from the city of Rome in Italy, were renowned for their military prowess and conquests. They also had a highly organized and efficient system of government, engineering marvels such as aqueducts, and a strong influence on language, law, and culture throughout Europe. In the Americas, the Mayans and Aztecs in Central America and the Incas in South America developed advanced societies with impressive architectural structures, complex systems of agriculture, and sophisticated calendars. These civilizations also had complex religious beliefs and practices that shaped their societies. One of the most fascinating aspects of ancient civilizations is their ability to develop advanced technologies without the use of modern tools and machinery. For example, the Egyptians used simple tools and techniques to build massive structures that still stand today. The Mayans created a writing system using pictographs, and the Greeks developed complex machines for warfare and everyday life, such as the water mill. Despite their differences, ancient civilizations all shared a common trait: the ability to thrive and develop in their unique environments. They each had their own distinct cultures, traditions, and ways of life, but they all left a lasting impact on the world through their advancements and innovations. Today, we continue to study and learn from these ancient civilizations, marveling at their achievements and seeking to understand their ways of life. They serve as a reminder of the incredible capabilities of humanity and the lasting legacies that can be left behind by these ancient societies. Sirens have been a part of Greek mythology for centuries, representing alluring and dangerous creatures that lured sailors to their deaths with their enchanting songs. These creatures, often depicted as half-woman and half-bird, have fascinated and intrigued people for generations. The myth of sirens has been passed down through various forms of art and literature, each with their own interpretations of these captivating creatures. In Homer's Odyssey, the sirens were described as beautiful maidens with powerful voices that would lure sailors to their deaths on the rocky shores. However, in later depictions, sirens were shown as monstrous and grotesque, with sharp teeth and claws. Despite the variations in their appearance, one thing remained consistent their irresistible singing. The sirens' songs were said to be so enchanting that no sailor could resist them, causing them to steer their ships towards the sirens' island, where they would meet their demise. The sirens' songs were not only seductive but also powerful, capable of causing storms and shipwrecks. This added to the allure and mystery surrounding these creatures, making them a symbol of danger and temptation. In modern times, the concept of sirens has evolved, and they are often depicted as strong and independent women who use their voices as a means of empowerment rather than destruction. However, the idea of sirens' songs being irresistible and alluring remains, reminding us of the power of music and its ability to captivate and entice. Whether seen as dangerous temptresses or symbols of female empowerment, the sirens' songs will continue to mesmerize and fascinate us for years to come. Homer's Odyssey is a timeless epic poem that tells the story of the Greek hero Odysseus and his journey home after the Trojan War. The poem is believed to have been composed in the 8th century BC and is considered one of the greatest works of literature in the Western world. The Odyssey is a continuation of Homer's other epic poem, the Iliad, which focuses on the Trojan War. However, unlike the Iliad, which mainly takes place during the last year of the war, the Odyssey covers a period of about 10 years, including Odysseus' long and arduous journey back to his home in Ithaca. The poem is divided into 24 books and is written in a poetic style known as dactylic hexameter, with each line consisting of six metrical feet. The Odyssey begins with the Greek gods discussing the fate of Odysseus, who has been stranded on the island of Ogygia for seven years, held captive by the nymph Calypso. The gods decide that it is time for Odysseus to return home, and they send the messenger god Hermes to persuade Calypso to release him. Odysseus is finally set free and sets sail on a makeshift raft, but his journey is far from over. He faces many challenges and obstacles, including encounters with mythical creatures such as the Cyclops, the Sirens, and the witch-goddess Circe. Throughout his journey, Odysseus displays his cunning and wit as he outwits his enemies and overcomes various challenges. He is also aided by the goddess Athena, who is on his side and helps him in his quest to return home. Meanwhile, back in Ithaca, Odysseus' wife Penelope is being pressured by suitors to choose a new husband, as they believe Odysseus to be dead. Penelope, however, remains faithful to her husband and devises clever ways to delay the suitors. Tell me, O muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide after he had sacked the famous town of Troy. Many cities did he visit, and many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted; moreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save his own life and bring his men safely home; but do what he might he could not save his men, for they perished through their own sheer folly in eating the cattle of the Sun-god Hyperion; so the god prevented them from ever reaching home. Look, I didnt want to be a half-blood. If youre reading this because you think you might be one, my advice is: close this book right now. Believe whatever lie your mom or dad told you about your birth, and try to lead a normal life. Being a half-blood is dangerous. Its scary. Most of the time, it gets you killed in painful, nasty ways. If youre a normal kid, reading this because you think its fiction, great. Read on. I envyyou for being able to believe that none of this ever happened. But if you recognize yourself in these pagesif you feel something stirring insidestop reading immediately. You might be one of us. And once you know that, its only a matter of time before they sense it too, and theyll come for you. Dont say I didnt warn you. My name is Percy Jackson. Im twelve years old. Until a few months ago, I was a boarding student at Yancy Academy, a private school for troubled kids in upstate New York. Am I a troubled kid? Yeah. You could say that. I could start at any point in my short miserable life to prove it, but things really started going bad last May, when our sixth-grade class took a field trip to Manhattantwenty-eight mental-case kids and two teachers on a yellow school bus, heading to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to look at ancient Greek and Roman stuff. I knowit sounds like torture. Most Yancy field trips were. But Mr. Brunner, our Latin teacher, was leading this trip, so I had hopes. Mr. Brunner was this middle-aged guy in a motorized wheelchair. He had thinning hair and a scruffy beard and a frayed tweed jacket, which always smelled like coffee. You wouldnt think hed be cool, but he told stories and jokes and let us play games in class. He also had this awesome collection of Roman armor and weapons, so he was the only teacher whose class didnt put me to sleep. I hoped the trip would be okay. At least, I hoped that for once I wouldnt get in trouble. Boy, was I wrong. See, bad things happen to me on field trips. Like at my fifth-grade school, when we went to the Saratoga battlefield, I had this accident with a Revolutionary War cannon. I wasnt aiming for the school bus, but of course I got expelled anyway. And before that, at my fourth-grade school, when we took a behind-the-scenes tour of the Marine World shark pool, I sort of hit the wrong lever on the catwalk and our class took an unplanned swim. And the time before that...Well, you get the idea. This trip, I was determined to be good. All the way into the city, I put up with Nancy Bobofit, the freckly, redheaded kleptomaniac girl, hitting my best friend Grover in the back of the head with chunks of peanut butter-and-ketchup sandwich. Grover was an easy target. He was scrawny. He cried when he got frustrated. He mustve been held back several grades, because he was the only sixth grader with acne and the start of a wispy beard on his chin. On top of all that, he was crippled. He had a note excusing him from PE for the rest of his life because he had some kind of muscular disease in his legs. He walked funny, like every step hurt him, but dont let that fool you. You shouldve seen him run when it was enchilada day in the cafeteria. Anyway, Nancy Bobofit was throwing wads of sandwich that stuck in his curly brown hair, and she knew I couldnt do anything back to her because I was already on probation. The headmaster had threatened me with death by in-school suspension if anything bad, embarrassing, or even mildly entertaining happened on this trip. Im going to kill her, I mumbled. Grover tried to calm me down. Its okay. I like peanut butter. He dodged another piece of Nancys lunch. Thats it. I started to get up, but Grover pulled me back to my seat. Youre already on probation, he reminded me. You know wholl get blamed if anything happens. Looking back on it, I wish Id decked Nancy Bobofit right then and there. In-school suspension wouldve been nothing compared to the mess I was about to get myself into. He rode up front in his wheelchair, guiding us through the big echoey galleries, past marble statues and glass cases full of really old black-and-orange pottery. It blew my mind that this stuff had survived for two thousand, three thousand years. He gathered us around a thirteen-foot-tall stone column with a big sphinx on the top, and started telling us how it was a grave marker, a stele, for a girl about our age. He told us about the carvings on the sides. I was trying to listen to what he had to say, because it was kind of interesting, but everybody around me was talking, and every time I told them to shut up, the other teacher chaperone, Mrs. Dodds, would give me the evil eye. Mrs. Dodds was this little math teacher from Georgia who always wore a black leather jacket, even though she was fifty years old. She looked mean enough to ride a Harley right into your locker. She had come to Yancy halfway through the year, when our last math teacher had a nervous breakdown. From her first day, Mrs. Dodds loved Nancy Bobofit and figured I was devil spawn. She would point her crooked finger at me and say, Now, honey, real sweet, and I knew I was going to get after-school detention for a month. One time, after shed made me erase answers out of old math workbooks until midnight, I told Grover I didnt think Mrs. Dodds was human. He looked at me, real serious, and said, Youre absolutely right. Mr. Brunner kept talking about Greek funeral art. Finally, Nancy Bobofit snickered something about the unclothed guy on the stele, and I turned around and said, Will you shut up? It came out louder than I meant it to. The whole group laughed. Mr. Brunner stopped his story. Mr. Jackson, he said, did you have a comment? My face was totally red. I said, No, sir. Mr. Brunner pointed to one of the pictures on the stele. Perhaps youll tell us what this picture represents? I looked at the carving, and felt a flush of relief, because I actually recognized it. Thats Kronos eating his kids, right? Yes, Mr. Brunner said, obviously not satisfied. And he did this because... Well... I racked my brain to remember. Kronos was the king god, and God? Mr. Brunner asked. Titan, I corrected myself. And...he didnt trust his kids, who were the gods. So, um, Kronos ate them, right? But his wife hid baby Zeus, and gave Kronos a rock to eat instead. And later, when Zeus grew up, he tricked his dad, Kronos, into barfing up his brothers and sisters Eeew! said one of the girls behind me. and so there was this big fight between the gods and the Titans, I continued, and the gods won. Some snickers from the group. Behind me, Nancy Bobofit mumbled to a friend, Like were going to use this in real life. Like its going to say on our job applications, Please explain why Kronos ate his kids. And why, Mr. Jackson, Brunner said, to paraphrase Miss Bobofits excellent question, does this matter in real life? Busted, Grover muttered. Shut up, Nancy hissed, her face even brighter red than her hair. At least Nancy got packed, too. Mr. Brunner was the only one who ever caught her saying anything wrong. He had radar ears. I thought about his question, and shrugged. I dont know, sir. I see. Mr. Brunner looked disappointed. Well, half credit, Mr. Jackson. Zeus did indeed feed Kronos a mixture of mustard and wine, which made him disgorge his other five children, who, of course, being immortal gods, had been living and growing up completely undigested in the Titans stomach. The gods defeated their father, sliced him to pieces with his own scythe, and scattered his remains in Tartarus, the darkest part of the Underworld. On that happy note, its time for lunch. Mrs. Dodds, would you lead us back outside? The class drifted off, the girls holding their stomachs, the guys pushing each other around and acting like doofuses. Grover and I were about to follow when Mr. Brunner said, Mr. Jackson. I knew that was coming. I told Grover to keep going. Then I turned toward Mr. Brunner. Sir? Mr. Brunner had this look that wouldnt let you gointense brown eyes that couldve been a thousand years old and had seen everything. You must learn the answer to my question, Mr. Brunner told me. About the Titans? About real life. And how your studies apply to it. Oh. What you learn from me, he said, is vitally important. I expect you to treat it as such. I will accept only the best from you, Percy Jackson. I wanted to get angry, this guy pushed me so hard. I mean, sure, it was kind of cool on tournament days, when he dressed up in a suit of Roman armor and shouted: What ho! and challenged us, sword- point against chalk, to run to the board and name every Greek and Roman person who had ever lived, and their mother, and what god they worshipped. But Mr. Brunner expected me to be as good as everybody else, despite the fact that I have dyslexia and attention deficit disorder and I had never made above a C in my life. Nohe didnt expect me to be as good; he expected me to be better. And I just couldnt learn all those names and facts, much less spell them correctly. I mumbled something about trying harder, while Mr. Brunner took one long sad look at the stele, like hed been at this girls funeral.He told me to go outside and eat my lunch. The class gathered on the front steps of the museum, where we could watch the foot traffic along Fifth Avenue. Sewing is an ancient craft that has been used for centuries to create clothing, accessories, and household items. It involves using a needle and thread to stitch fabric together to form a desired shape or design. Sewing has evolved over time, from being a necessary skill for survival to now being a popular hobby and form of self-expression. In the past, sewing was primarily done by hand, with each stitch carefully placed and executed. However, with the invention of the sewing machine in the 19th century, the process became much faster and more efficient. Today, there are numerous types of sewing machines available, from basic models to advanced computerized ones. Despite the advancements in technology, hand sewing still remains a beloved and important aspect of sewing, as it allows for more intricate and delicate work. Sewing also requires a variety of tools, such as scissors, pins, measuring tape, and patterns, which help to create precise and professional-looking garments. It is a skill that requires patience, attention to detail, and creativity. Sewing is not just limited to creating clothing, as it can also be used to make home decor items like curtains, pillows, and quilts. It is a versatile skill that allows individuals to express their personal style and create unique and one-of-a-kind pieces. In addition to being a creative outlet, sewing can also be a practical and cost-effective way to mend or alter clothing, saving money and reducing waste. Overall, sewing is a timeless and valuable skill that continues to be passed down from generation to generation, connecting individuals to their past and allowing them to create a more sustainable and personal future. You should sew a halloween treat bags. You could sew a beautiful apron! BRIAN ROBESON stared out the window of the small plane at the endless green northern wilderness be- low. It was a small plane, a Cessna 406 a bush- plane and the engine was so loud, so roaring and consuming and loud, that it ruined any chance for conversation. Not that he had much to say. He was thirteen and the only passenger on the plane with a pilot named what was it? Jim or Jake or something- who was in his mid forties and who had been silent as he worked to prepare for take off. In fact since Brian had come to the small airport in Hampton, New York to meet the plane driven by his mother the pilot had spoken only five words to him. "Get in the copilot's 'Seat." Which Brian had done. They had taken off and that was the last of the conversation. There had been the initial excitement, of course. He had never flown in a single-engine plane before and to be Sitting in the copilot's seat with all the controls right there in front of him, all the instruments in his face as the plane clawed for altitude, jerking and sliding on the wind currents as the pilot took off, had been interesting and exciting. But in five minutes they had leveled off at six thousand feet and headed north-west and from then on the pilot had been silent, staring out the front, and the drone of the engine had been all that was left. The drone and the sea of green trees that lay before the plane's nose and flowed to the horizon, spread with lakes, swamps, and wandering streams and rivers. Now Brian sat, looking out the window with the roar thundering through his ears, and tried to catalog what had led up to his taking this flight. The thinking started. Always it started with a single word, Divorce. hi, i'm james. The boy ran a marathon. I like to eat cake. she is called Kathleen. Dogs are fun and playfull pets. I met a man named Jon. the yellow house has two floors. The red car is very fast! Jim is a very nice guy. The tree has green leafs and brown bark. we are going to eat at 6 o' clock. I am a bit hungry right now. the boy is going to school. they are eating at McDonalds. we do not eat dirt. The train is going to the station. the road gets very hot in the summer. I want to go to the moon! you are climbing a tree. They are building a greek temple to the god Aphrodite. The trees flower in spring. you and I are friends. Percy's farts are stinky and grose! ripe apples are red. bananas are yellow and have a lot of potasium. Percy likes to play in the sandbox. It is a clear, windy day, perfect for flying a kite! the wizard is cleaning his robes. the boy has orange braces. the girl is eating an orange. last week, they saw the total solar eclips. he is a world renowned astrophysicist. Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets - but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day. "Up! Get up! Now!" Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again. "Up!" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he'd had the same dream before. His aunt was back outside the door. "Are you up yet?" she demanded. "Nearly," said Harry. "Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don't you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday." Harry groaned. "What did you say?" his aunt snapped through the door. "Nothing, nothing" Dudley's birthday - how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise - unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. Harry didn't look it, but he was very fast. Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. "In the car crash when your parents died," she had said. "And don't ask questions. "Don't ask questions - that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon. "Comb your hair!" he barked, by way of a morning greeting. While modern civilizations extend to every continent except Antarctica, most scholars place the earliest cradles of civilizations—in other words, where civilizations first emerged—in modern-day Iraq, Egypt, India, China, Peru and Mexico, beginning between approximately 4000 and 3000 B.C.

A car is a means of transport used for traveling from one place to another. This is a four wheeled vehicle that is used by individuals or groups to travel. We all use cars in our daily lives to go from one place to another for work. A car is a beautiful vehicle that has comfortable seats, AC, and windows. It is basically used to reduce travel distance and time. Due to increased automobile industries, we see different types of cars ranging from simple to the most luxurious ones. Every individual wishes to buy or purchase a car which makes their journey a comfortable and enjoyable experience. A dog can bark. i am the supreme overlord, bow to me humans. a dog is a small mammal often used as a pet by select humans. Mitigating erosion involves taking steps to reduce or prevent the negative impact of erosion. Here are a few general strategies for different types of erosion: Environmental Erosion: Plant Vegetation: Planting trees and shrubs to hold soil in place, Use Terracing: Creating terraces on slopes to slow down water runoff, Install Erosion Control Fabrics: Using mats or fabrics to stabilize the soil. Financial Erosion: Diversify Investments: Spreading investments across various asset classes to reduce risk, Monitor Expenses: Keeping a close watch on spending to prevent unnecessary financial losses, Inflation Protection: Investing in assets that typically keep pace with or exceed inflation rates. Organizational Erosion, Enhance Employee Engagement: Improving workplace culture and employee satisfaction to retain talent, Regular Training: Providing continuous learning opportunities to keep skills up-to-date, Effective Communication: Ensuring clear and open communication channels within the organization. Philosophy ('love of wisdom' in Ancient Greek) is a systematic study of general and fundamental questions concerning topics like existence, reason, knowledge, value, mind, and language. It is a rational and critical inquiry that reflects on its own methods and assumptions. Historically, many of the individual sciences, such as physics and psychology, formed part of philosophy. However, they are considered separate academic disciplines in the modern sense of the term. Influential traditions in the history of philosophy include Western, Arabic-Persian, Indian, and Chinese philosophy. Western philosophy originated in Ancient Greece and covers a wide area of philosophical subfields. A central topic in Arabic-Persian philosophy is the relation between reason and revelation. Indian philosophy combines the spiritual problem of how to reach enlightenment with the exploration of the nature of reality and the ways of arriving at knowledge. Chinese philosophy focuses principally on practical issues in relation to right social conduct, government, and self-cultivation. Major branches of philosophy are epistemology, ethics, logic, and metaphysics. Epistemology studies what knowledge is and how to acquire it. Ethics investigates moral principles and what constitutes right conduct. Logic is the study of correct reasoning and explores how good arguments can be distinguished from bad ones. Metaphysics examines the most general features of reality, existence, objects, and properties. Other subfields are aesthetics, philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, philosophy of religion, philosophy of science, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of history, and political philosophy. Within each branch, there are competing schools of philosophy that promote different principles, theories, or methods. Philosophers use a great variety of methods to arrive at philosophical knowledge. They include conceptual analysis, reliance on common sense and intuitions, use of thought experiments, analysis of ordinary language, description of experience, and critical questioning. Philosophy is related to many other fields, including the sciences, mathematics, business, law, and journalism. It provides an interdisciplinary perspective and studies the scope and fundamental concepts of these fields. It also investigates their methods and ethical implications. Existence is the state of having being or reality in contrast to nonexistence and nonbeing. Existence is often contrasted with essence: the essence of an entity is its essential features or qualities, which can be understood even if one does not know whether the entity exists. Ontology is the philosophical discipline studying the nature and types of existence. Singular existence is the existence of individual entities while general existence refers to the existence of concepts or universals. Entities present in space and time have concrete existence in contrast to abstract entities, like numbers and sets. Other distinctions are between possible, contingent, and necessary existence and between physical and mental existence. The common view is that an entity either exists or not with nothing in between, but some philosophers say that there are degrees of existence, meaning that some entities exist to a higher degree than others. The orthodox position in ontology is that existence is a second-order property or a property of properties. For example, to say that lions exists means that the property of being a lion is possessed by an entity. A different view states that existence is a first-order property or a property of individuals. This means existence is similar to other properties of individuals, like color and shape. Alexius Meinong and his followers accept this idea and say that not all individuals have this property; they state that there are some individuals, such as Santa Claus, that do not exist. Universalists reject this view; they see existence as a universal property of every individual. The concept of existence has been discussed throughout the history of philosophy and already played a role in ancient philosophy, including Presocratic philosophy in Ancient Greece, Hindu and Buddhist philosophy in Ancient India, and Daoist philosophy in ancient China. It is relevant to fields such as logic, mathematics, epistemology, philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, and existentialism. Reality is the sum or aggregate of all that is real or existent within the universe, as opposed to that which is only imaginary, nonexistent or nonactual. The term is also used to refer to the ontological status of things, indicating their existence. In physical terms, reality is the totality of a system, known and unknown. Philosophical questions about the nature of reality or existence or being are considered under the rubric of ontology, which is a major branch of metaphysics in the Western philosophical tradition. Ontological questions also feature in diverse branches of philosophy, including the philosophy of science, of religion, of mathematics, and philosophical logic. These include questions about whether only physical objects are real (i.e., physicalism), whether reality is fundamentally immaterial (e.g. idealism), whether hypothetical unobservable entities posited by scientific theories exist, whether a god or gods exist, whether numbers and other abstract objects exist, and whether possible worlds exist. Epistemology is concerned with what can be known or inferred as likely and how, whereby in the modern world emphasis is put on reason, empirical evidence and science as sources and methods to determine or investigate reality. The universe is all of space and timea and their contents. It comprises all of existence, any fundamental interaction, physical process and physical constant, and therefore all forms of energy and matter, and the structures they form, from sub-atomic particles to entire galactic filaments. Space and time, according to the prevailing cosmological theory of the Big Bang, emerged together 13.787±0.020 billion years ago, and the universe has been expanding ever since. Today the universe has expanded into an age and size that is physically only in parts observable as the observable universe, which is approximately 93 billion light-years in diameter at the present day, while the spatial size, if any, of the entire universe is unknown. Some of the earliest cosmological models of the universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and were geocentric, placing Earth at the center. Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led Nicolaus Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the Sun at the center of the Solar System. In developing the law of universal gravitation, Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus's work as well as Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion and observations by Tycho Brahe. Further observational improvements led to the realization that the Sun is one of a few hundred billion stars in the Milky Way, which is one of a few hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe. Many of the stars in a galaxy have planets. At the largest scale, galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the universe has neither an edge nor a center. At smaller scales, galaxies are distributed in clusters and superclusters which form immense filaments and voids in space, creating a vast foam-like structure. Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the universe had a beginning and has been expanding since then. According to the Big Bang theory, the energy and matter initially present have become less dense as the universe expanded. After an initial accelerated expansion called the inflationary epoch at around 10-32 seconds, and the separation of the four known fundamental forces, the universe gradually cooled and continued to expand, allowing the first subatomic particles and simple atoms to form. Giant clouds of hydrogen and helium were gradually drawn to the places where matter was most dense, forming the first galaxies, stars, and everything else seen today. From studying the effects of gravity on both matter and light, it has been discovered that the universe contains much more matter than is accounted for by visible objects; stars, galaxies, nebulas and interstellar gas. This unseen matter is known as dark matter, (dark means that there is a wide range of strong indirect evidence that it exists, but we have not yet detected it directly) having come into existence alongside the rest of the physical universe before gradually gathering into a foam-like structure of filaments and voids and allowing other forms of matter to form together into visible structures. The ΛCDM model is the most widely accepted model of the universe. It suggests that about 69.2%±1.2% of the mass and energy in the universe is dark energy which is responsible for the acceleration of the expansion of the universe, and about 25.8%±1.1% is dark matter. Ordinary ('baryonic') matter is therefore only 4.84%±0.1% of the physical universe. Stars, planets, and visible gas clouds only form about 6% of the ordinary matter. There are many competing hypotheses about the ultimate fate of the universe and about what, if anything, preceded the Big Bang, while other physicists and philosophers refuse to speculate, doubting that information about prior states will ever be accessible. Some physicists have suggested various multiverse hypotheses, in which the universe might be one among many. Space is a three-dimensional continuum containing positions and directions. In classical physics, physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions. Modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime. The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework. In the 19th and 20th centuries mathematicians began to examine geometries that are non-Euclidean, in which space is conceived as curved, rather than flat, as in the Euclidean space. According to Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, space around gravitational fields deviates from Euclidean space. Experimental tests of general relativity have confirmed that non-Euclidean geometries provide a better model for the shape of space. In geometry, a three-dimensional space (3D space, 3-space or, rarely, tri-dimensional space) is a mathematical space in which three values (coordinates) are required to determine the position of a point. Most commonly, it is the three-dimensional Euclidean space, that is, the Euclidean space of dimension three, which models physical space. More general three-dimensional spaces are called 3-manifolds. The term may also refer colloquially to a subset of space, a three-dimensional region (or 3D domain), a solid figure. Technically, a tuple of n numbers can be understood as the Cartesian coordinates of a location in a n-dimensional Euclidean space. The set of these n-tuples is commonly denoted R^n and can be identified to the pair formed by a n-dimensional Euclidean space and a Cartesian coordinate system. When n = 3, this space is called the three-dimensional Euclidean space (or simply "Euclidean space" when the context is clear). In classical physics, it serves as a model of the physical universe, in which all known matter exists. When relativity theory is considered, it can be considered a local subspace of space-time. While this space remains the most compelling and useful way to model the world as it is experienced, it is only one example of a large variety of spaces in three dimensions called 3-manifolds. In this classical example, when the three values refer to measurements in different directions (coordinates), any three directions can be chosen, provided that these directions do not lie in the same plane. Furthermore, if these directions are pairwise perpendicular, the three values are often labeled by the terms width/breadth, height/depth, and length. Mathematics is a field of study that discovers and organizes abstract objects, methods, theories and theorems that are developed and proved for the needs of empirical sciences and mathematics itself. There are many areas of mathematics, which include number theory (the study of numbers), algebra (the study of formulas and related structures), geometry (the study of shapes and spaces that contain them), analysis (the study of continuous changes), and set theory (presently used as a foundation for all mathematics). Mathematics involves the description and manipulation of abstract objects that consist of either abstractions from nature or—in modern mathematics—purely abstract entities that are stipulated to have certain properties, called axioms. Mathematics uses pure reason to prove properties of objects, a proof consisting of a succession of applications of deductive rules to already established results. These results include previously proved theorems, axioms, and—in case of abstraction from nature—some basic properties that are considered true starting points of the theory under consideration. Mathematics is essential in the natural sciences, engineering, medicine, finance, computer science, and the social sciences. Although mathematics is extensively used for modeling phenomena, the fundamental truths of mathematics are independent from any scientific experimentation. Some areas of mathematics, such as statistics and game theory, are developed in close correlation with their applications and are often grouped under applied mathematics. Other areas are developed independently from any application (and are therefore called pure mathematics), but often later find practical applications. Historically, the concept of a proof and its associated mathematical rigour first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid's Elements. Since its beginning, mathematics was primarily divided into geometry and arithmetic (the manipulation of natural numbers and fractions), until the 16th and 17th centuries, when algebraa and infinitesimal calculus were introduced as new fields. Since then, the interaction between mathematical innovations and scientific discoveries has led to a correlated increase in the development of both. At the end of the 19th century, the foundational crisis of mathematics led to the systematization of the axiomatic method, which heralded a dramatic increase in the number of mathematical areas and their fields of application. The contemporary Mathematics Subject Classification lists more than sixty first-level areas of mathematics. Agriculture encompasses crop and livestock production, aquaculture, and forestry for food and non-food products. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities. While humans started gathering grains at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers only began planting them around 11,500 years ago. Sheep, goats, pigs, and cattle were domesticated around 10,000 years ago. Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world. In the 20th century, industrial agriculture based on large-scale monocultures came to dominate agricultural output. As of 2021, small farms produce about one-third of the world's food, but large farms are prevalent. The largest 1% of farms in the world are greater than 50 hectares (120 acres) and operate more than 70% of the world's farmland. Nearly 40% of agricultural land is found on farms larger than 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres). However, five of every six farms in the world consist of fewer than 2 hectares (4.9 acres), and take up only around 12% of all agricultural land. Farms and farming greatly influence rural economics and greatly shape rural society, effecting both the direct agricultural workforce and broader businesses that support the farms and farming populations. The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, fuels, and raw materials (such as rubber). Food classes include cereals (grains), vegetables, fruits, cooking oils, meat, milk, eggs, and fungi. Global agricultural production amounts to approximately 11 billion tonnes of food, 32 million tonnes of natural fibres and 4 billion m3 of wood. However, around 14% of the world's food is lost from production before reaching the retail level. Modern agronomy, plant breeding, agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers, and technological developments have sharply increased crop yields, but also contributed to ecological and environmental damage. Selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about animal welfare and environmental damage. Environmental issues include contributions to climate change, depletion of aquifers, deforestation, antibiotic resistance, and other agricultural pollution. Agriculture is both a cause of and sensitive to environmental degradation, such as biodiversity loss, desertification, soil degradation, and climate change, all of which can cause decreases in crop yield. Genetically modified organisms are widely used, although some countries ban them. Social media has revolutionized the way people communicate, transforming traditional methods into fast-paced, interactive, and highly connected experiences. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok have enabled individuals to share their thoughts, experiences, and ideas with a global audience instantly. This shift has both positive and negative consequences on modern communication. On the positive side, social media has made it easier for people to stay in touch with friends and family, no matter the distance. It has also provided a platform for marginalized voices to be heard, fostering social movements and bringing attention to critical issues such as racial injustice, climate change, and gender equality. Businesses leverage social media for marketing, reaching wider audiences, and engaging with customers directly. However, the drawbacks are significant. The rise of misinformation and fake news is a major concern, as false information spreads quickly and can have real-world consequences. Social media can also contribute to mental health issues, as constant exposure to curated images and lifestyles can lead to feelings of inadequacy and anxiety. Additionally, the nature of online interactions often lacks the depth and nuance of face-to-face communication, potentially leading to misunderstandings and conflict. In today’s fast-paced world, the importance of mental health cannot be overstated. Mental health encompasses our emotional, psychological, and social well-being, affecting how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is crucial at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. Good mental health is essential for overall well-being. When mental health is compromised, it can affect physical health, leading to chronic conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. Conversely, poor physical health can also contribute to mental health issues, creating a vicious cycle. Recognizing the signs of mental health problems, such as persistent sadness, excessive fears, or extreme mood changes, is vital for early intervention and treatment. Mental health problems are common, but help is available. Many people with mental health problems recover completely or are able to live with and manage their symptoms with the right treatments. Psychotherapy, medication, and lifestyle changes can significantly improve mental health. Additionally, community support, such as family, friends, and mental health professionals, plays a critical role in recovery. Reducing the stigma associated with mental health is also crucial. Stigma can prevent individuals from seeking help and can lead to discrimination in various aspects of life, including work and relationships. Education and awareness campaigns can help change societal attitudes and encourage people to talk openly about their mental health. Overall, prioritizing mental health and seeking help when needed is essential for living a fulfilling and healthy life. Promoting mental health awareness and support systems in communities can lead to a more understanding and supportive society. Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power, are becoming increasingly important as the world seeks to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and mitigate climate change. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable energy sources are abundant, sustainable, and produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions.

Mathematics, often perceived as a complex and abstract field, is fundamentally the science of numbers, quantities, shapes, and patterns, and their relationships. It is a discipline that has been integral to human civilization, contributing to various fields such as science, engineering, economics, and even art. To understand what mathematics is, we must explore its origins, its various branches, its applications, and its philosophical underpinnings. The history of mathematics is as old as human civilization itself. Early evidence of mathematical activity dates back to ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, and India, where basic arithmetic, geometry, and algebra were used for practical purposes such as trade, astronomy, and construction. The Babylonians developed a sophisticated numerical system and could solve quadratic equations, while the Egyptians used geometry to calculate areas and volumes necessary for their architectural marvels. In ancient Greece, mathematics became more abstract and theoretical. Mathematicians like Euclid, Archimedes, and Pythagoras laid the foundations of geometry and number theory. Euclid’s "Elements" is one of the most influential works in the history of mathematics, systematically presenting the principles of geometry. The Greeks also delved into the philosophical aspects of mathematics, pondering the nature of numbers and the concept of infinity. The medieval period saw the transfer of mathematical knowledge to the Islamic world, where scholars such as Al-Khwarizmi and Omar Khayyam made significant contributions to algebra and trigonometry. The Renaissance period in Europe revived mathematical study, leading to groundbreaking work by mathematicians like Fibonacci, Descartes, and Newton. The development of calculus by Newton and Leibniz in the 17th century revolutionized mathematics, providing tools to describe change and motion. Mathematics is a vast field, broadly divided into several branches, each with its own focus and methods. The main branches include: Arithmetic: The study of numbers and basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is the foundation of all mathematics, dealing with the properties and manipulation of numbers. Algebra: This branch involves the study of symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols. Algebra is used to represent numbers and relationships in a general form. It includes solving equations, working with polynomials, and understanding functions. Geometry: The study of shapes, sizes, and properties of space. Geometry deals with points, lines, planes, and figures, and their relationships. It has practical applications in art, architecture, and engineering. Trigonometry: The study of relationships between the angles and sides of triangles. Trigonometry is essential in fields such as physics, engineering, and astronomy, where it helps in understanding wave patterns and circular motion. Calculus: The study of change and motion. Calculus, developed by Newton and Leibniz, involves differentiation and integration, which are used to find rates of change and areas under curves, respectively. It is crucial in physics, engineering, and economics. Statistics and Probability: These branches deal with the analysis of data and the study of random events. Statistics involves collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data, while probability deals with the likelihood of events occurring. They are essential in fields like biology, economics, and social sciences. Discrete Mathematics: The study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. It includes topics such as graph theory, combinatorics, and algorithms. Discrete mathematics is vital in computer science and information theory. Number Theory: The study of properties and relationships of numbers, particularly integers. Number theory explores concepts such as prime numbers, divisibility, and modular arithmetic. It has applications in cryptography and coding theory. Applications of Mathematics Mathematics is not just an abstract field but has practical applications that are fundamental to various domains. In science and engineering, mathematics provides the language and tools for formulating and solving problems. Physics relies heavily on calculus to describe motion and forces, while engineering uses algebra and geometry for designing structures and systems. In biology, mathematical models help understand population dynamics, genetics, and the spread of diseases. In economics, mathematics is essential for modeling economic behavior, analyzing markets, and making financial decisions. Concepts from calculus, statistics, and linear algebra are used to understand and predict economic trends. Computer science relies on discrete mathematics, algorithms, and probability for designing software, encryption, and data analysis. In medicine, statistical methods are crucial for analyzing clinical trials and medical research. Mathematics is also used in medical imaging technologies, such as MRI and CT scans, where algorithms reconstruct images from raw data. Environmental science uses mathematical models to study climate change, pollution, and resource management. Even in art and music, mathematics plays a significant role. Geometry and symmetry are fundamental in visual arts, while concepts of rhythm, harmony, and acoustics in music are deeply rooted in mathematics. The Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio are examples of mathematical patterns found in nature and used in artistic compositions. The philosophy of mathematics explores the nature and scope of mathematical knowledge. One fundamental question is whether mathematical objects, such as numbers and shapes, exist independently of human thought. This debate has led to various philosophical positions: Platonism: This view holds that mathematical objects exist in an abstract, non-physical realm. According to Platonists, mathematical truths are discovered rather than invented, and they exist independently of human minds. Formalism: Formalists argue that mathematics is a creation of the human mind, consisting of formal systems of symbols and rules. According to this view, mathematical statements are true by virtue of their derivation from axioms within a formal system. Intuitionism: This philosophy emphasizes the mental construction of mathematical objects. Intuitionists believe that mathematical truths are not discovered but are created by the human mind, and they reject the existence of mathematical objects independent of human thought. Logicism: Logicists, such as Frege and Russell, attempted to reduce mathematics to logic, arguing that mathematical truths are logical truths. They sought to show that mathematical concepts could be defined in purely logical terms. These philosophical perspectives highlight the deep and complex nature of mathematics, prompting ongoing debates about its foundations and implications. Mathematics is a profound and multifaceted discipline that is integral to human knowledge and progress. From its historical roots in ancient civilizations to its modern applications in science, engineering, economics, and beyond, mathematics has continually evolved, offering tools and insights that shape our understanding of the world. Its various branches provide frameworks for analyzing and solving problems, while its philosophical underpinnings provoke deep reflection on the nature of reality and human thought. Understanding what mathematics is requires appreciating both its abstract beauty and its practical utility. It is a universal language that transcends cultural and temporal boundaries, a testament to the power of human intellect and creativity. As we continue to explore and expand the frontiers of mathematics, we uncover new dimensions of knowledge that inspire wonder and drive innovation, cementing mathematics' role as a cornerstone of human achievement. Essence (Latin: essentia) has various meanings and uses for different thinkers and in different contexts. It is used in philosophy and theology as a designation for the property or set of properties or attributes that make an entity the entity it is or, expressed negatively, without which it would lose its identity. Essence is contrasted with accident, which is a property or attribute the entity has accidentally or contingently, but upon which its identity does not depend. In logic and philosophy (especially metaphysics), a property is a characteristic of an object; a red object is said to have the property of redness. The property may be considered a form of object in its own right, able to possess other properties. A property, however, differs from individual objects in that it may be instantiated, and often in more than one object. It differs from the logical/mathematical concept of class by not having any concept of extensionality, and from the philosophical concept of class in that a property is considered to be distinct from the objects which possess it. Understanding how different individual entities (or particulars) can in some sense have some of the same properties is the basis of the problem of universals. Metaphysics is the branch of philosophy that examines the basic structure of reality. It is often characterized as first philosophy, implying that it is more fundamental than other forms of philosophical inquiry. Metaphysics is traditionally seen as the study of mind-independent features of the world, but some modern theorists understand it as an inquiry into the conceptual schemes that underlie human thought and experience. Many general and abstract topics belong to the subject of metaphysics. It investigates the nature of existence, the features all entities have in common, and their division into categories of being. An influential contrast is between particulars, which are individual unique entities, like a specific apple, and universals, which are general repeatable entities that characterize particulars, like the color red. Modal metaphysics examines what it means for something to be possible or necessary. The nature of space, time, and change is also discussed by metaphysicians. A closely related issue concerns the essence of causality and its relation to the laws of nature. Other topics include how mind and matter are related, whether everything in the world is predetermined, and whether there is free will. Metaphysicians employ various methods to conduct their inquiry. Traditionally, they rely on rational intuitions and abstract reasoning but have more recently also included empirical approaches associated with scientific theories. Due to the abstract nature of its topic, metaphysics has received criticisms questioning the reliability of its methods and the meaningfulness of its theories. Metaphysics is relevant to many fields of inquiry that often implicitly rely on metaphysical concepts and assumptions. The origin of metaphysics lies in antiquity with speculations about the nature of reality and the universe, like those found in the Upanishads in ancient India, Daoism in ancient China, and pre-Socratic philosophy in ancient Greece. The subsequent medieval period in the West discussed the nature of universals as shaped by ancient Greek philosophers Plato and Aristotle. The modern period saw the emergence of various comprehensive systems of metaphysics, many of which embraced idealism. In the 20th century and contemporary period, a "revolt against idealism" was started, and metaphysics was once declared meaningless, then revived with various criticisms of earlier theories and new approaches to metaphysical inquiry. In geometry, a point is an abstract idealization of an exact position, without size, in physical space, or its generalization to other kinds of mathematical spaces. As zero-dimensional objects, points are usually taken to be the fundamental indivisible elements comprising the space, of which one-dimensional curves, two-dimensional surfaces, and higher-dimensional objects consist; conversely, a point can be determined by the intersection of two curves or three surfaces, called a vertex or corner. In classical Euclidean geometry, a point is a primitive notion, defined as "that which has no part". Points and other primitive notions are not defined in terms of other concepts, but only by certain formal properties, called axioms, that they must satisfy; for example, "there is exactly one straight line that passes through two distinct points". As physical diagrams, geometric figures are made with tools such as a compass, scriber, or pen, whose pointed tip can mark a small dot or prick a small hole representing a point, or can be drawn across a surface to represent a curve. Since the advent of analytic geometry, points are often defined or represented in terms of numerical coordinates. In modern mathematics, a space of points is typically treated as a set, a point set. An isolated point is an element of some subset of points which has some neighborhood containing no other points of the subset. In geometry, the orientation, attitude, bearing, direction, or angular position of an object - such as a line, plane or rigid body - is part of the description of how it is placed in the space it occupies. More specifically, it refers to the imaginary rotation that is needed to move the object from a reference placement to its current placement. A rotation may not be enough to reach the current placement, in which case it may be necessary to add an imaginary translation to change the object's position (or linear position). The position and orientation together fully describe how the object is placed in space. The above-mentioned imaginary rotation and translation may be thought to occur in any order, as the orientation of an object does not change when it translates, and its position does not change when it rotates. Euler's rotation theorem shows that in three dimensions any orientation can be reached with a single rotation around a fixed axis. This gives one common way of representing the orientation using an axis-angle representation. Other widely used methods include rotation quaternions, rotors, Euler angles, or rotation matrices. More specialist uses include Miller indices in crystallography, strike and dip in geology and grade on maps and signs. A unit vector may also be used to represent an object's normal vector orientation or the relative direction between two points. Typically, the orientation is given relative to a frame of reference, usually specified by a Cartesian coordinate system. Two objects sharing the same direction are said to be codirectional (as in parallel lines). Two directions are said to be opposite if they are the additive inverse of one another, as in an arbitrary unit vector and its multiplication by -1. Two directions are obtuse if they form an obtuse angle (greater than a right angle) or, equivalently, if their scalar product or scalar projection is negative. In Euclidean geometry, a translation is a geometric transformation that moves every point of a figure, shape or space by the same distance in a given direction. A translation can also be interpreted as the addition of a constant vector to every point, or as shifting the origin of the coordinate system. In a Euclidean space, any translation is an isometry. Distance geometry is the branch of mathematics concerned with characterizing and studying sets of points based only on given values of the distances between pairs of points. More abstractly, it is the study of semimetric spaces and the isometric transformations between them. In this view, it can be considered as a subject within general topology. Historically, the first result in distance geometry is Heron's formula in 1st century AD. The modern theory began in 19th century with work by Arthur Cayley, followed by more extensive developments in the 20th century by Karl Menger and others. Distance geometry problems arise whenever one needs to infer the shape of a configuration of points (relative positions) from the distances between them, such as in biology, sensor networks, surveying, navigation, cartography, and physics. Physics is the natural science of matter, involving the study of matter, its fundamental constituents, its motion and behavior through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force. Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines. A scientist who specializes in the field of physics is called a physicist. Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines and, through its inclusion of astronomy, perhaps the oldest. Over much of the past two millennia, physics, chemistry, biology, and certain branches of mathematics were a part of natural philosophy, but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century these natural sciences emerged as unique research endeavors in their own right.a Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as biophysics and quantum chemistry, and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences and suggest new avenues of research in these and other academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy. Advances in physics often enable new technologies. For example, advances in the understanding of electromagnetism, solid-state physics, and nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society, such as television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.

Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts, such as taxes, in a particular country or socio-economic context. The primary functions which distinguish money are: medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value and sometimes, a standard of deferred payment. Money was historically an emergent market phenomenon that possessed intrinsic value as a commodity; nearly all contemporary money systems are based on unbacked fiat money without use value. Its value is consequently derived by social convention, having been declared by a government or regulatory entity to be legal tender; that is, it must be accepted as a form of payment within the boundaries of the country, for "all debts, public and private", in the case of the United States dollar. The money supply of a country comprises all currency in circulation (banknotes and coins currently issued) and, depending on the particular definition used, one or more types of bank money (the balances held in checking accounts, savings accounts, and other types of bank accounts). Bank money, whose value exists on the books of financial institutions and can be converted into physical notes or used for cashless payment, forms by far the largest part of broad money in developed countries.
